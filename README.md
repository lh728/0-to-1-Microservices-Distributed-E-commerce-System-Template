# 0-to-1-Microservices-Distributed-E-commerce-System-Template
This is a microservices-based distributed e-commerce system template designed to leverage a wide range of advanced management tools and practices from 0 to 1.

**I would like to use the latest technologies as much as possible to complete this e-commerce template.**

## Project Setup Guide

### Virtual Machine

Download a Linux virtual machine based on Windows using **VirtualBox** (Make sure to enable CPU virtualization mode).

Download the official image via Vagrant, create a Linux virtual machine by `vagrant init centos/7`, and modify the Vagrantfile network settings (change the private network to your computer's IP address for domain name mapping; you can find your IP address using the '`ipconfig`' command).

<br>

### Install Docker

```bash
# Update the software packages
sudo yum update -y

# Install necessary dependencies to be able to install Docker from the official repository
sudo yum install -y yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2

# Add the Docker official repository
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo

# Install Docker Engine (Docker CE)
sudo yum install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Start the Docker service and set it to start on boot
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

# Confirm that Docker is correctly installed and running
sudo docker --version

# Verify that Docker is working properly
sudo docker run hello-world

```

<br>

### Install mysql 8.0.17

```bash
# Pull the MySQL 8.0.17 image
docker pull mysql:8.0.17

# Run the MySQL container. Remember to create the necessary data volume directories using mkdir.
docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysql-container \
-v /mydata/mysql/log:/var/log/mysql \
-v /mydata/mysql/data:/var/lib/mysql \
-v /mydata/mysql/conf:/etc/mysql \
-v /mydata/mysql-files:/var/lib/mysql-files -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=425658167 mysql:8.0.17

# Verify if the MySQL container is running
docker ps

# Set the character encoding (if needed). Create a my.cnf file in /mydata/mysql/conf using vi.
[mysqld]
character-set-server=utf8

[client]
default-character-set=utf8

```

<br>

### Install redis

```bash
# Pull the Redis image
docker pull redis

# Run the Redis container
docker run -p 6379:6379 --name redis -v /mydata/redis/data:/data \
-v /mydata/redis/conf/redis.conf:/etc/redis/redis.conf \
-d redis redis-server /etc/redis/redis.conf

# Verify if the Redis container is running
docker ps

# Interact with Redis (optional)
docker exec -it redis redis-cli

# The latest Redis versions have persistence enabled by default, so you don't need to modify the configuration file for now. 

```

<br>

### **Environment**

Java17.0.6 

MAVEN 3.9.2

Git

<br>

### Dependency

Springboot 3.1.4

Spring Web

Spring Cloud Routing - openFeign (microservices communication)

<br>

### Database Design

**(No foreign keys will be established due to the hypothetical e-commerce project. This is to avoid potential performance impacts, as e-commerce databases often deal with a large volume of data.)**

The following databases will be established: 

The character set will be set to utf8mb4 to ensure compatibility with utf8 and address potential issues related to character encoding.

You can find the details of the CREATE TABLE statement here. <a href = "https://github.com/lh728/0-to-1-Microservices-Distributed-E-commerce-System-Template/tree/e72007596d45fa6a3885afc0e1dd9b42357ee3d0/Static" >Github</a>

## Administraion System

For the backend management, we will directly use the existing "renren-fast" to save time.

The project's GitHub repository can be found at the following address: [https://github.com/renrenio/renren-fast.git](https://github.com/renrenio/renren-fast.git)

For the front-end pages, we use "renren-fast-vue" to achieve rapid development: https://github.com/renrenio/renren-fast-vue.git

To start the administration service, a database named "ADMIN" needs to be created. The table creation statements for this database can also be found in the following location: <a href = "https://github.com/lh728/0-to-1-Microservices-Distributed-E-commerce-System-Template/tree/e72007596d45fa6a3885afc0e1dd9b42357ee3d0/Static" >Github</a>
